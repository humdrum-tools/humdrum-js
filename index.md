This website documents the humdrum-js library, which consists of serveral
[javascript objects](/object) for parsing digital music scores in the
Humdrum data format.

The website is currently under construction, but
you can view the source code for the javascript code
[here](https://js.humdrum.org/scripts/humdrum.js) and the individual
components of the combined file [here](https://js.humdrum.org/scripts/components).
